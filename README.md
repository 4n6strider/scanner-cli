Hawkeye is a project security, vulnerability and general risk highlighting tool.  It has a few goals:

  - Designed to be entirely extensible by just adding new modules with the correct signature to [lib/modules](lib/modules)
  - Modules return results via a common interface, which permits consolidated reporting and artefact generation
  - Should be easy to run, be it via NPM, or Docker, on your Host, or in a CI Server

## Modules
As I mentioned above, modules are simply isolated bits of code that _could_ run against the target that is being scanned.  The following modules are currently implemented:

### Generic Modules:
 - __File Names (files)__: Scan the file list recursively, looking for patterns as defined in [data.js](lib/modules/files/data.js).  We're looking for things like `id_rsa`, things that end in `pem`, etc.
 - __File Content Patterns (contents)__: Looks for patterns as defined in [data.js](lib/modules/content/data.js) within the contents of files, things like 'password: ', and 'BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY' will pop up here.
 - __File Content Entropy (entropy)__:  Scan files for strings with high (Shannon) entropy, which could indicate passwords or secrets stored in the files, for example: 'kwaKM@Â£rFKAM3(a2klma2d'

### Node JS:
 - __Node Security Project (nsp)__: Scan the package.json (if present) and check for vulnerabilities on [Node Security Project](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp)
 - __NPM Check Updates (ncu)__: Wraps the [NPM Check Updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) module, to highlight outdated dependencies with increasing severity.

### Ruby:
 - __Ruby Bundler Audit (bundlerAudit): Wraps [Bundler Audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) to check your Gemfile/Gemfile.lock for known vulnerabilities. (Thanks to [Laura](https://github.com/lauraionescu))

I really, really do welcome people writing new modules so please check out [lib/modules/example-shell/index.js](lib/modules/example-shell/index.js) as an example of how simple it is, and send me a pull request.

## Current Limitations
 - Entropy is disabled by default because it can return a lot of results, which are mostly misses, to run it please use the `-m entropy` switch, personally I use this manually checking over code bases I have inherited.
 - We only look inside the contents of files up to 20kb, I plan to add configuration options in the future to allow you to change this.

## Running Hawkeye
I wanted Hawkeye to be as flexible as possible, as a result it supports numerous methods of execution.

### Standalone (command line)
There are two ways to run Hawkeye from the command line, the first is the easiest if you have nodejs on your host, simply type `npm install -g hawkeye-scanner` which will add the `hawkeye` binary to your path.

If you don't have nodejs on your machine, or simply don't want anything on your host, you can use docker with `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/target stono/hawkeye`.

__Note__: If you opt for docker and you are on macosx, please be aware that the `osxfs` is approx 20x slower than native filesystem access, so if you're scanning a particularly large project you may experience some slow down and the `npm` choice would be a better option.

### As part of your docker-compose file
This is where Hawkeye is lovely, lets say you have project which has a `Dockerfile`, with lines like this in:

```
COPY . /app
VOLUME /app
```

You could add hawkeye to your compose file like this:

```
services:
  app:
    build: .

  hawkeye:
    image: stono/hawkeye
    command: scan -t /app
    volumes_from:
      - app
```

You can simply do `docker-compose run --rm --no-deps hawkeye`.  Woo hoo.

### As part of your GoCD pipeline
If you're using [ci-in-a-box](https://github.com/Stono/ci-in-a-box) or something similar, you can add a pipeline step to run these scans automatically.  This is an example of running against the latest built image.

```
<pipeline name="security-scan">
  <stage name="Hawkeye" cleanWorkingDir="true">
    <jobs>
      <job name="scan">
        <tasks>
          <exec command="docker">
            <arg>pull</arg>
            <arg>stono/hawkeye</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
          <exec command="bash">
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>docker pull eu.gcr.io/your-project-name/your-image-name:latest</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
          <exec command="bash">
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>docker run --entrypoint=/bin/true --name=your-image-name_latest eu.gcr.io/your-project-name/your-image-name:latest</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
          <exec command="bash">
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>docker run --rm --volumes-from your-image-name_latest stono/hawkeye scan --target /app</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
          <exec command="bash">
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>docker rm -f your-image-name_latest</arg>
            <runif status="any" />
          </exec>
        </tasks>
      </job>
    </jobs>
  </stage>
</pipeline>
```

## Easy Configuration
As of version `0.9.0`, you can use the familiar `.hawkeyerc` and `.hawkeyeignore` pattern in your project root.

### .hawkeyerc
In this example, we'll run the `contents`, `entropy`, `files`, `ncu` and `nsp`
```
{
  "modules": ["contents", "entropy", "files", "ncu", "nsp"],
  "failOn": "medium"
}
```

### .hawkeyeignore
This file should be a collection of patterns to exclude from the scan
```
^test/
README.md
```

## The CLI
### `hawkeye scan`
There are a few options available:

#### -a, --all: Running against all files rather than git tree
Hawkeye by default will attempt to detect a .git folder in your target, if it is there it will only scan git tracked files.  Further to that, if a .git-crypt folder is detected, we will also exclude files which are GPG encrypted.  If there is no .git in the target directory, then all files will be scanned.

You can override this behaviour with the `--all` flag, which will scan all files regardless.

#### -f, --fail-on <low, medium, high, critical>: When to exit with a non-zero status code
From a pipeline perspective, the `--fail-on` command is useful, you might now wish for `low` items to break your build, so you could use `--fail-on medium`.

#### -t, --target  </path/to/project>: Specfiy what to scan
By default Hawkeye will look in your current working directory.  You can override this behaviour though by specifying a `--target`

#### -m, --module  <module name>: Running only specific modules
If you want to run specific modules only, you can use the `--module` flag, which can be specified multiple times.  For example `hawkeye scan -m nsp -m ncu` would run just the nsp and ncu modules.

#### -j, --json    </path/to/summary.json>: Produce a JSON artefact
The `--json` paramter allows you to write a much more detailed report to a file. See the Json section below for more information

#### -s, --sumologic    <http://sumologic-http-collector>: Send the results to SumoLogic
This will post the results to a SumoLogic HTTP collector.  See the SumoLogic section below for more information.

#### -e, --exclude  <pattern>: Exclude files that match a specified RegEx pattern
This paramter (which can be specified multiple times) allows you to specify patterns you wish to be excluded from the scan.  For example `hawkeye scan -e "^test/"` would exclude all your test files.  All paths are __relative__ to the `--target`.

There are some global exclusions in place, and those are "^.git/" and "^node_modules".

### `hawkeye modules`
You can view the module status with `hawkeye modules`.  As previously mentioned you can see that entropy is disabled by default.  If you want to run it, use the `-m entropy` flag.

I plan to add options to supress log outputs etc in the future, but for now if you want to parse this output, you can supress the logs and just output the table like this:

```

```

Here are some other handy examples:

- `(hawkeye scan >/dev/null) 2>&1 | tail -n +3 | grep critical` - output just critical items

Another option is for you to use a different output writer, for example...

### Json
You can output much more information in the form of a JSON artefact that groups by executed module.

Check out a sample [here](test/samples/results.json)

### SumoLogic
The output of Hawkeye can be sent to a SumoLogic HTTP collector of your choice.  In this example, I have a collector of `hawkeye`, with a single HTTP source.
```
hawkeye scan --sumo https://collectors.us2.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/your-http-collector-url

...
[info] Doing writer: sumologic
[info] sending 16 results to SumoLogic
```

And in sumo logic, search for `_collector="hawkeye" | json auto`:

![SumoLogic](screenshots/sumologic.png)

## Development

### Adding a new handler
The idea is that this project should be super extensible, I want people to write new handlers with ease.  Simply create a handler in `lib/modules` which exposes the following signature:

  - key: A short alphanumeric key for your module
  - name: The name of your module
  - description: The description of your module
  - enabled: True or Fale as to if this module should run by default, or if it needs to be specified with `--module`
  - function handles(path): A function to decide if this handler should run against the target path
  - function run(results, done): The function which is called if handles returns true

### The run function
The first argument passed is `results`, this is where the module should send its results to, it exposes four methods for each 'level' of issue found, `critical`, `high`, `medium` and `low`.  Those methods expect you to pass something like this:

```
results.critial('offender', 'description', 'extra', { additional: 'data' });
```
